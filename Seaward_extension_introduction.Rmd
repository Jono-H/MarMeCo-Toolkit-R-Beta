# Seaward Extension Guidance {.unnumbered}

Delineate  a seaward extension boundary from a colony of breeding seabirds.

SEAWARD EXTENSION DEFINITION: These are marine areas immediately surrounding seabird breeding colonies. The areas are typically used for ecologically relevant behaviours such as rafting, preening, bathing, foraging or transiting between foraging trips, depending on a species.

This tutorial uses the example data for Adelie Penguins. For information on the original study, see Handley et al. 2021 Marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas for Penguins in Antarctica, Targets for Conservation Action. Frontiers in Marine Science 7: 602972. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.602972

While this tutorial is designed to allow minimal input from the user, users should understand the consequence of choices to input parameters while using the functions provided.

**What does this tutorial cover:**

-   1. Creating a suitable background raster (grid file) fpr use in the seaward extension method

-   2. Tutorial on how to produce a raster density grid and a polygon site boundary output for a seabird colony

-   3. Tutorial on how to produce raster density grids and polygon site boundaries outputs for a multiple seabird colonies and combine them to produce a stack final output.

**Inputs to this tutorial:**

1.   Polygon (shapefile) of land

2.   Seabird colony location(s) (latitude and longitude)

3.   Colony size(s) (number of breeding pairs)

4.   Radius around the colony (distance in km)

**Guidance for inputs:**

1.   Polygon (shapefile) of land

2.   Seabird colony location (latitude and longitude)

3.   Colony size (number of breeding pairs)

4.   Radius around the colony(distance in km)

- Possible distances: maxium, mean maximum, mean
- Could be from tracking (e.g. if sample size is too small to use track2KBA)
- Could be informed by at sea surveys

**Output(s) from this tutorial, can be used to:**

-   assess data against relevant criteria, such as:

    -   IBA criteria: <http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/ibacriteria>

    -   KBA criteria: <https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/working-with-kbas/proposing-updating/criteria>\

-   or, for identification of sites from animal tracking data to be used in alternate spatial planning exercises.
