# Track2KBA Guidance

<!--- This is an HTML comment in RMarkdown. You can use these comments to make notes that won't get read when running the code -->
<!--- If you don't understand what a RMarkdown document is. Stop here. Go learn. -->
<!--- Equally. You must understand the difference between Markdown vs. RMarkdown -->

<!--- Remember, outside of the R code chunks we are now coding in HTML syntax, not R syntax -->
<!--- In the code chunk below, we specify include = F, so that we will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document. We set a global argument in the code chunk of echo = T, so that in later code chunks, the code will be displayed in the RMarkdown document -->


##```{r setup, include=FALSE}
##knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
##```

<!--- add two spaces at the end of a sentence to start the next sentence on a new line
or add <br> between each sentence you want on a new line -->
This analysis was performed in `r sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string`

<!--- Add a space after the line to start the bulleted list -->
<!--- Placing **text** will make text bold -->
