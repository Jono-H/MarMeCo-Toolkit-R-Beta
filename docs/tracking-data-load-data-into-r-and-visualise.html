<p>The type of device you use will dictate what format your raw tracking data is stored in.</p>
<p>Typically, we will work with <strong>.csv</strong> files.</p>
<p>Good file management is critical when working with large tracking datasets.</p>

<p>Depending on your file structure, type of raw data, and size of your overall data, we recommend reading data into R in a way that produces a single data frame (or tibble) for all your data required for a specific analysis.</p>
<p>[Example R code for reading in raw tracking data is provided in the Appendix]</p>

<p>Having data standardised into a common format greatly improves reproducible research, and also the ability for data to be used in other studies.</p>
<p>The primary format we recommend is that of BirdLife International’s Seabird Tracking Database:
- <a href="https://www.seabirdtracking.org/" class="uri">https://www.seabirdtracking.org/</a></p>
<p>We recognise, however, that this format may not be appropriate for all analyses. Nevertheless, we encourage users to standardise their data into a common format. This will facilitate the ease through which data can be reformatted when necessary for other analyses.</p>
<p>[Decide on best way to show example datasets - either as screen shot images? Or as example data files? Or perhaps as both. Maybe just taking subsets of the data as required.]</p>

<p>Below, we load the raw tracking data obtained for Yelkouan Shearwaters.</p>
<p>To see how this data was loaded into R originally, and merged to create a single data frame, see the example code in the Appendix.</p>

<p>The <code>load</code> function supports loading various R file formats. Here we are loading an <code>.Rdata</code> file. The file was previously saved with the name of <code>yelk</code>.

<p><strong>tibble vs data frame</strong>: we don’t go into the specifics of these different data formats. The key message is that each provides a different way of interacting with, or viewing, data. Both are essentially a mechanism through which to work with tabular data. (i.e. data in rows and columns)</p>

<p>For the following columns, you may notice a few things:
<br></p>
<ul>
<li><p>dataset_id is specified as <em>tbc</em>. This is because until data has been loaded into the SBTD, it will not have a unique dataset identification code that would relate to the dataset stored in the SBTD.</p></li>
<li><p>lat_colony, lon_colony are specified as <em>tbc</em>, because we still need to define what the colony coordinates would be for each of locations birds were tagged from.</p></li>
<li><p>bird_id, track_id, original_track_id, are all specified with the same code. This is because when data is formatted to align with the format of the SBTD:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have a code that relates to the bird that was tracked (bird_id)</li>
<li>we have a SBTD unique code that relates to each trip undertaken by the bird, when multiple trips are recorded (track_id). Note though, it is often the case that users do not provide data which has been pre-split into unique trips. Therefore, it is often the case that all entries relating to track_id match that of bird_id.</li>
<li>we have a user defined code that can relate to each trip undertaken by the bird. However, the same caveat in the case of track_id applies to this column of data too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>argos_quality and equinox are both specified as NA. This is because our data relates to GPS data which does not have an argos_quality estimate (typical of PTT devices) or a measure relating to the equinox (typical of GLS devices).</p></li>

<p>Before you plot any data, it can be a good idea to broadly explore the data.</p>
<p>While you might know which species you tracked, and from which colonies, and from which years, it can often be worth checking over these (and other) aspects of your data.</p>
<p>Checking the data helps refresh your view on what data you have, and also helps you pick up any errors that may have arisen when inputting data.</p>

<li>site_name: we have tracking data from one general site</li>
<li>colony_name: we have tracking data from three colonies</li>

<li>breed_status and breed_stage: all data relates to breeding birds in the chick-rearing life-cycle stage.</li>
<li>age and sex: data is from adult birds of unknown sex</li>
<li>n_birds, n_tracks, n_original_tracks: because n_birds = n_tracks, it indicates that:

<p>Once you have formatted your data into a standardised format and ensured that parts of your data is inputted correctly, it is also worth ensuring your data is ordered (arranged) correctly chronologically. An artifact of manipulating spatial data is that sometimes the data can become un-ordered with respect to time, or, given the way various devices interact with satellites, you can also end up with duplicated entries according to timestamps.</p>
<p>This can be a first problem, causing your track to represent unrealistic movement patterns of the animal.</p>
<p>We need to ensure our data is ordered correctly and also remove any duplicate timestamps.</p>

<p>Using the <code>leaflet</code> package in R, you can easily visualise your tracking data interactively within RStudio.</p>
<p>What should you look for when visualising the raw data?
* Are your locations in realistic places?
* Have you perhaps mixed up the latitude and longitude columns?
* Does your data cross the international date line? Do you know how to deal with this?
* Will you need to remove sections of the data that do not represent a time when the animal was tagged? (e.g. perhaps you set the device to start recording locations before deploying on the animal. So the tag might have recorded while you were travelling to the deployment location. Therefore, removing these sections of the track will facilitate your overall analysis.)</p>

<p>Based on the interactive plot, you can see that generally the data looks good. Generally, all the locations are in the Adriatic Sea area (something we would anticipate based on what we know about Yelkouan Shearwaters breeding in Croatia). We can conclude the following:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Locations appear to be in realistic places.</li>
<li>It’s unlikely that we have mixed up the latitude and longitude columns.</li>
<li>The data does not cross the international date line.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Regarding removing sections of the data that do not represent a time when the animal was tagged: Later filtering steps may remove these parts of the track if locations are near the vicinity of the colony (see details of the <code>tripSplit()</code> function. However, if there are broader location data associated with these types of locations, you will need to remove these sections of the track.</p>

<p>Visualising all the location data in R can be a simpler starting point. You may also want to save this data as a shapefile (.shp) for viewing in GIS software such as QGIS or ArcGIS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: saving all data as a single shapefile can be a memory intensive task (i.e. if you have a lot of data, then your computer might take a long time to save the file, or the file will be big and slow to work with)</p>

<p>Once you have reviewed the overall status of the tracking data you collected, it can be worth assessing the tracks of individual animals.</p>
<p>This can give you a better idea of the quality of the data for each individual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Visualising tracking data from individual animals can help you understand which data you might remove, or which data you might try and salvage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on the amount of data you have, you can often initially a perform a static exploration of tracks from each individual (i.e. a simple plot of tracks from each individual), followed by an interactive exploration of tracks from all individuals, or only data from those individuals where interactive exploration is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Below, outlines options for visualising individual animal tracks.</p>

<p>In some cases, an entire track may be worth disregarding or trying to salvage. However, it often might be the case that only certain trips from the entire period an animal was tracked may be worth removing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NEXT STEP: Split data from individual animal into unique trips and then consider assessing each unique trip for data quality</strong></p>
